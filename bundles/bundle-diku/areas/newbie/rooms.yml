  description: >-
    There are several things that you need to know when playing
    this MUD, so these rooms are designed to show you the basics
    of playing Vampire Wars. The first thing you need to know
    is how to move around. Type "exits" to see where you can go.
    Then type the direction that you wish to go. North takes you
    to the next room, where you will learn something about your
    armour class. To bring up this description again, type "look"

- id: armourclass
  title: "Your Armour Class"
  description: >-
    Now type "score". This brings up a screen of information
    about your character. One important piece of information
    is your armour class - this determines how tough you are
    and how resistant to attacks you will be. Basically, the
    lower your armour class, the less likely you are to be 
    hurt. In the score sheet, your armour class is represented
    by the value next to "ac". To lower this value, you must
    wear armour and other equipment. To see what you are 
    currently wearing, type "equipment".

  title: "Killing"
  description: >-
    In this room there is a monster called a munchkin. 
    It is a very weak monster, so you won't have any trouble 
    killing it - type "consider munchkin". However, it is wearing a munchkin helmet that you 
    might want to use. To kill it, type "kill munchkin". When 
    it is dead, you will see a message saying "The corpse of 
    the munchkin contains : a munchkin helmet". Take the helmet 
    by typing "get helmet corpse". Now wear it by typing 
    "wear helmet". If you type "score" now, you will see that 
    your ac has gone down, and you have more exp. We will learn 
    about this later. Now go north to the next room.

  title: "Weapons"
  description: >-
    In this room is another monster. This monster, however, 
    is equipped with a munckin sword. Kill it, and then you 
    can take the sword from the corpse and wield it 
    (type "wield sword"). Now when  you type "score", you 
    will notice that your hit and dam values have gone up. 
    These values mean that you will be more likely to hit 
    your opponent and do more damage to them during combat. 
    The higher these values, the better.
    One more thing you might like to do is sacrifice the 
    corpse. This will give you one piece of gold, and the 
    satisfaction that your opponent - type "sacrifice 
    corpse". Proceed north to the next room.

  description: >-
    After you have read this, type "prac1" and then "prac2" 
    (Remember you can view this description again by typing 
    "look"). These screens show what you have practise - most
    of them are spells. You will notice that they are all 
    on 0% - you can increase this by typing "practise" 
    followed by the spell name. This uses up some experience
    points, which you have gained by killing the munchkins 
    in the previous rooms. When you have done this, go north
    to the next room.
  exits:
    - roomId: "newbie:training"

  title: "Training"
  description: >-
    In previous iterations of Vampire Wars, training was used
    to gain attributes, stats, immunities, and other sources
    of power. Now, all of your stats is increased by two things:
    gear and level. Because of this, the train command has been
    removed. Sorry for the convenience.

    Go north to the next room now.
  exits:
    - roomId: "newbie:doors"
      direction: north
    - roomId: "newbie:spells"
      direction: south

  title: "Doors"
  description: >-
    Now try to go east. You will see that there is a door
    blocking your way - this means that it doesn't show up
    when you type "exits". To open the door, all you have 
    to do is type "open door", and then the exit east will 
    show up when you type "exits".

    Go east, and then you can return to proceed north.

  title: "Time to enter the game..."
  description: >-
    Now you are ready to enter Vampire Wars. You now know how
    to move around and kill monsters, how to equip yourself 
    and train yourself to a higher standard. These are the bare
    basics that you will need to survive in Vampire Wars, but
    there is much, much more to discover. A couple of things 
    you might like to try are - ansi (this *may* give you colour),
    autoexit (shows you the obvious exits to the room on 
    entering), autoloot and autosac (these get all from a corpse
    and sacrifice it automatically after a kill - be careful 
    though, because you may sacrifice a corpse which has something
    valuable in it, as you have a limit to the amount you can 
    carry). Also, all commands can be shortened - for instance, 
    "look" can be just "l" and "east" can be just "e". 

    Now, type "recall" to enter the game!
