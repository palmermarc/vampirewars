The Ranvier engine itself doesn't prescribe or prefer any certain type of combat, it simply has tools
in place to allow you to implement which ever type of combat you prefer. This bundle is an example
implementation of Diku-style autoattack combat.

Many of your favorite Diku things are built in automatically, including:

* Attack commands (kill, berserk, etc.)
* Stances that control multiple aspects of combat including attacks per round, damage, and damage mitigation
* NPC behaviors that allow for combat and stancing of NPCs
* Any combat-related effects that are necessary for combat to be effective (stun, poison, damage over time)
